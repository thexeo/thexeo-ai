## Overview

**Thexeo AI** is designed to process digital marketing and SEO data at high speed using GPU-accelerated computations. It automates the collection of visitor statistics from `thexeo.com`, calculates performance metrics, and stores this data in a MySQL database for further analysis or reporting. This project serves as a backend solution for clients needing real-time, high-performance data processing in their marketing strategies.

## Features

- **GPU-Accelerated Computations:** Performs calculations using CUDA-enabled GPUs for faster processing.
- **SEO and Digital Marketing Data:** Collects visitor data from `thexeo.com` to analyze website performance.
- **Database Integration:** Automatically inserts processed data into a MySQL database for storage and retrieval.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- GPU with CUDA Support (for enhanced performance)
- Python with necessary packages (installed via Docker)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:yourusername/thexeo-ai.git
   cd thexeo-ai
   docker-compose up --build
   app-1  | Data inserted successfully Status Code: 200
   docker-compose stop
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up -d

$ docker ps
