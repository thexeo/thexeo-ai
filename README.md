How to Earn $THEXEO Token Airdrop
By running the Thexeo AI Project Worker, you can participate in the $THEXEO token airdrop. Here's what you need to do:


Setup the Worker Node:
Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine.
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/thexeo/thexeo-ai.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
cd thexeo-ai
Deploy the worker using Docker Compose:
bash
docker-compose up -d

Running the Worker:
Once deployed, the worker will start processing tasks relevant to Thexeo AI's decentralized network. Each task completed increases your eligibility for the token airdrop.

Airdrop Eligibility:

Contribution: The more you contribute by running the worker node, the higher your chances of receiving a larger share of the airdrop.
Periodicity: Airdrops might be distributed at set intervals or upon reaching certain milestones within the project. Check the project's announcements for specific dates.

## Overview

**Thexeo AI** is designed to process digital marketing and SEO data at high speed using GPU-accelerated computations. It automates the collection of visitor statistics from `thexeo.com`, calculates performance metrics, and stores this data in a MySQL database for further analysis or reporting. This project serves as a backend solution for clients needing real-time, high-performance data processing in their marketing strategies.

## Features

- **GPU-Accelerated Computations:** Performs calculations using CUDA-enabled GPUs for faster processing.
- **SEO and Digital Marketing Data:** Collects visitor data from `thexeo.com` to analyze website performance.
- **Database Integration:** Automatically inserts processed data into a MySQL database for storage and retrieval.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- GPU with CUDA Support (for enhanced performance)
- Python with necessary packages (installed via Docker)

## Getting Started
